I always considered myself to be an indecisive person. I used to spend so much time overthinking that I would get stuck in a loop trying to review every single possibility and its possible outcome. Some even consider me to be a walking paradox: one day I would be set on one idea and the next, I would completely contradict myself.

Deciding to learn Software Development was very unexpected and purely intuitive. It simply felt right and the reasons came flowing to me as if I had thought about it for a long time. I guess you could say the opportunity showed itself in the right place at the right time.

Prior to starting my journey with Flatiron School, I was not only in search of something new and challenging, but I also wanted something useful that would open the doors to more possibilities. Living in a time where technology has been spreading and growing at an exponential rate rather than gradual, it seemed obvious to me that learning Software Development was something that I had to do.

Today technology is everywhere you go and no matter what industry youâ€™re in, you will be exposed to some kind of application. Having the basic skills to understand how an application works seems essential to me, and if we continue at this rate, it could potentially become as crucial as knowing how to read and write.

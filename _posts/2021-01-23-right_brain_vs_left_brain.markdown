Starting my journey with Flatiron School made me face many hours of heavy thinking and stressful moments. As hard as I tried, the labs seemed to always be a complication for me. I quickly realized that this was simply because of my nonlinear way of thinking.

When I was finally able to arrive at a solution, I would realize that it was right in front of me the whole time. I constantly found myself wondering why I kept taking the longest route. After several times of experiencing this, I noticed a pattern: my thinking process was not sequential, instead, it was more like floating ideas without any structure nor boundaries.

This was a huge realization for me because for the first time I was able to “observe” my own thoughts and how I was processing information. Figuratively speaking, my “right-brain” was clearly more dominant than my “left brain”. This helped me explain so many things about myself, such as why I was always drawn to art, my passion for music, and my tendency for making connections from completely unrelated ideas.

Because I was determined to learn computer programming, I refused to simply give up and instead opted to learn how to think like a computer. I had to spend a lot of time researching and googling around to be able to integrate and develop this way of thinking, aka logic. I quickly felt like I had entered a deep, dark rabbit hole; I found myself asking some of life’s basic questions, reading about different philosophical ideas, and even got into deep psychology.

Learning Software Development has truly been a growing experience both professionally and personally. It has opened the doors to a new career possibility and allowed me to develop another way of thinking that was just sitting in my shadow. This learning experience has been a fun and challenging ride, and I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge in the world of Software Development.

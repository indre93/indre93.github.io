For our fourth portfolio project with Flatiron School, we are required to build a Single Page Application using Ruby on Rails for our backend API and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for our frontend. 

I decided to make a game application for a couple of reasons: I thought it would be easier and quicker, and I just love playing video games.  

After a few hours of coding and getting through the initial set up, I quickly realized that this was about to be the most challenging project so far. Even though I was tempted, multiple times, to start over and make a simpler application, I decided to move forward with my original idea. I mean, who doesn’t love a challenge. 

So, the name of my game application is “Balloon Popper”, and here is a little preview of it:

Very simple and straight forward game application. But I must admit that this project was a truly learning experience, and it was definitely far from being easy and quick. It took me way longer than expected, and I ran into an unexpected number of obstacles.  

Now, looking back I am happy that I never gave up and was able to push myself to be persistent to complete this game application, I not only learned to appreciate the beauty of JavaScript but I also feel like I got a glimpse of how amazing the world of game development is.

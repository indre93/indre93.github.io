After hours of debugging and sleepless nights my journey with Flatiron School has almost come to an end. It has been a very exciting and challenging experience, filled with unexpected events (such as that of COVID-19) with many moments of personal growth and realizations.

After my JavaScript project was completed, I honestly thought that this project would be a lot more difficult than it actually was. It felt like as I was progressing, every project just kept getting harder and harder. Looking back I realize that it was just me and my own high expectations.

Although the last project was very time consuming and a lot more difficult than expected, I really learned to appreciate the art behind vanilla JavaScript and all of its capabilities. For my Rails application project, I originally wanted it to be a lot more interactive with the least amount of page reloads, and JavaScript really opens the door to this possibility. Now, working with Redux and React (both built with just vanilla JavaScript) really simplifies the application building process, allowing us to create even more innovative and interactive web apps, canâ€™t say no to that!

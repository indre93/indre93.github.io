For our third portfolio project with Flatiron School, we are required to build a complete Ruby on Rails application that manages related data through complex forms, and RESTful routes.

So, I decided to build an application that lets users keep track of their workouts by listing the exercises performed, and as well as their routines for each of those exercises. Users can view each other's workouts not only to stay motivated, but to also get ideas on different exercises and routines performed by others.

For me, building an application using Ruby on Rails can be easily described using two simple words, fun and challenging.

It was a fun experience because Rails opens the door to so many possibilities allowing us to really go the extra mile when it comes to building a web application. By abstracting away all the basic, repetitive code needed for a web application to start running, we are given the space to fully focus on the creation of the application from a user's standpoint.

Now, this can be a real challenge since you are now face to face with an infinite amount of possibilities and narrowing this down to one can truly be one of the most difficult parts when developing an application.  Having a clear ideal on what you want for your application is an essential component to avoid getting lost and/or confused along the process of developing.

Overall, the Rails portfolio project was my favorite so far and I look forward to revisiting this application to add more as I continue to learn.
